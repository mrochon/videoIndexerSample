## Count people

These two notebooks show Python code needed to:

1. slice a video into still frames (images)
2. use Azure AI to count number of people in the image

[calculateWaitTime notebook](https://github.com/mrochon/videoIndexerSample/blob/main/python/calculateWaitTime.ipynb) contains both functions and uses Azure GPT-4o-mini to count people in the image.

[detectPeopleUsingAIVision](https://github.com/mrochon/videoIndexerSample/blob/main/python/detectPeopleUsingAIVision.ipynb) notebook uses AI Vision Cognitive Service to count people in same images.

Both notebooks include rough cost estimates for the AI processing.
